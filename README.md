# Projects-by-G

During my course of work, I gained an introduction to ML (Machine Learning) and Deep development, along with practical experience in learning and solving simple examples of real AI (Artificial Intelligence) problems through programming. This provided me with a solid foundation in the field.

I actively worked on REST API's, Python programming language, and various Machine Learning concepts. These concepts helped me understand the underlying principles and techniques used in ML. By implementing and executing projects such as Reverse-Image-Search and Sentiment Analysis, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the AI group and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Reverse-Image-Search involved building a system that could find similar images based on a provided input image. This required utilizing image processing techniques and ML algorithms to extract meaningful features and compare them with a database of images.

Sentiment Analysis, on the other hand, focused on analyzing and categorizing the sentiment expressed in textual data. By leveraging ML models, I developed a system that could identify whether a given text had a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

These practical experiences not only enhanced my understanding of ML and Deep development but also contributed significantly to my final year project. The knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course helped me recall and apply the concepts effectively, leading to a successful completion of my project.
